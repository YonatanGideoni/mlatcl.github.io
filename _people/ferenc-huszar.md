biography: "Ferenc finished his PhD in Machine Learning at the Cambridge
  University Engineering Department in 2013. At that time he worked on Bayesian
  inference, nonparametric and kernel methods. Since then, he has worked in the
  London technology sector: in various tech startups and briefly in venture
  capital. He served as Principal Research Scientist at deep learning startup
  Magic Pony Technology, focussed on applying machine learning to the problem of
  lossy image and video compression. Following the acquisition of Magic Pony by
  Twitter in 2016, he served as Senior Machine Learning Researcher at Twitter
  where he worked on a range of ML-related projects including computer vision,
  recommender systems and ML ethics and fairness. He joined the Department of
  Computer Science and Technology in 2020 as a Senior Lecturer and continues to
  advise Twitter's ML Ethics, Transparency and Accountability (META) team as a
  staff research scientist."
