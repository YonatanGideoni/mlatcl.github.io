  Francisco is a PhD student in the Computer Laboratory, focusing on topics at
  the interface of stochastic control and inference. His research is
  predominantly applied and experimental with a particular interest in data
  assimilation across the natural sciences. Some of the main themes he has
  recently been interested in learning about / exploring include:


  \- Gaussian Processes


  \- Filtering in SDEs (Kalman-Bucy Filter)


  \- Dynamic / Entropic Optimal Transport (Schrodinger Bridges)


  \- Stochastic Control (HJB Equation)


  \- Computational Bayesian Inference


  \- Grey Box models (Semi mechanistic modelling / Data assimilation)


  \- Signal Processing / Kernel Methods 


  \- ML approaches to formal langauge generation and verification
