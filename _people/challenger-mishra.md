biography: Challenger is developing machine-driven approaches to problems in
  String Theory and related Calabi-Yau geometries, studying the vast landscape
  of String Theory solutions using a combination of tools and techniques from
  machine learning and mathematical physics. His work seeks to deepen
  understandings of the map between String Theory models and the Standard Model
  of particle physics.
