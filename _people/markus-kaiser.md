biography: Markusâ€™s research seeks to encode expert knowledge into hierarchical
  probabilistic models to formulate informative prior assumptions. At Siemens,
  he works with domain experts to create reliable machine learning systems that
  are insightful for engineers. In his research, he explores how Bayesian
  non-parametric models can be composed to enforce abstract constraints, yield
  principled reasoning under uncertainty, and enable scalable and reliable
  inference.
