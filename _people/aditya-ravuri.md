biography: Aditya's interests are mainly in probabilistic machine learning and he
  works on probabilistic interpretations of dimensionality reduction methods used in
  single cell biology. His current work interprets a large class of DR methods such as
  (t-)SNE and UMAP, LLE, LE, diffusion maps and spectral embedding methods as inference algorithms
  corresponding to models on latent graphs, with connections to Gaussian processes on graphs and manifolds.
  He also works on several case studies of using latent variable models in practice.
