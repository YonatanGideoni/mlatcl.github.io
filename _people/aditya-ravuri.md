biography: Aditya's interests are mainly in probabilistic machine learning and he
  works on probabilistic interpretations of dimensionality reduction methods used in
  single cell workflows. His current work focuses on interpretations of methods
  such as (t-)SNE and UMAP, which can be thought of as latent graph inference methods
  with connections to graph Gaussian processes, and DTW-type algorithms which have
  connections to HMMs and are widely applicable.
