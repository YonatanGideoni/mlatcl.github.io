  title: About
  heading: ML@CL is creating safe and reliable machine learning systems that can
    be deployed to tackle real-world challenges.
  content: Amidst growing excitement about AI, a gap has emerged between our
    aspirations for AI and our ability to deploy these technologies to tackle
    real-world challenges. ML@CL aims to bridge this gap through innovations in
    modelling, systems and software engineering for machine learning deployment;
    the application of AI for scientific discovery; and the development of
    policy frameworks for trustworthy and beneficial AI.

  title: Research
  heading: Our work addresses the full pipeline of AI system development, from
    data acquisition, through model development to system deployment.
  content: We work closely with practitioners, domain experts and policymakers to
    understand and respond to the real-world challenges associated with AI
    deployment. Our research spans the fundamentals of machine learning methods,
    statistical emulation and uncertainty quantification, real-time inference
    and decision-making, systems design, the application of AI in science and
    industry, data stewardship, and AI policymaking. Find out more about current
    projects on our Research pages.
