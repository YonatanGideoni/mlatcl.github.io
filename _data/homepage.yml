  title: 01 About
  heading: ML@CL is creating safe and reliable machine learning systems that can
    be deployed to tackle real-world challenges.
  content: While excitement about the potential of AI technologies continues to
    build, a gap is emerging between our aspirations for AI and our ability to
    deploy these technologies to tackle real-world challenges. ML@CL aims to
    bridge this gap through innovations in machine learning methods,
    applications, and policymaking.
