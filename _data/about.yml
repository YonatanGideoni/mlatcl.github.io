  ### **Achieving the full potential of AI – and its benefits for society and
  the economy – requires the ability to safely and effectively deploy AI systems
  at scale.**


  Through research at the frontiers of machine learning methods, applications, and policymaking, ML@CL supports the deployment of machine learning to tackle real-world challenges. Our ambition is to create a new generation of machine learning and AI technologies that serve science and society. 


  ML@CL’s research programmes tackle different aspects of AI systems design and deployment. Our work on AI for innovation considers the opportunities AI creates for scientific discovery, and the new research agendas that emerge at the interface of AI and the sciences. Our programme on machine learning in deployment is investigating how technical advances can help address issues of interpretability, reliability, resilience and fairness in large AI systems. 


  We examine where, how and for whose benefit machine learning systems are developed and deployed through our policy programme. Across our work, we engage closely with practitioners, domain experts and policymakers to develop AI tools that are fit for real-world deployment.
