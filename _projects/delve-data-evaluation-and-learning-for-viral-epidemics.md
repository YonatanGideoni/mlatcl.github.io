COVID-19 brought a pressing need to analyse emerging data from countries around the world to identify the factors that could help slow the spread of the virus and help find long-term solutions to the pandemic. 

DELVE (Data Evaluation and Learning for Viral Epidemics) was a multi-disciplinary group, convened by the Royal Society in 2020, to support a data-driven approach to learning from the different approaches countries are taking to managing the pandemic. This effort was welcomed by Government, who have arranged for it to provide input through SAGE, its scientific advisory group for emergencies.

DELVE contributed data driven analysis to complement the evidence base informing the UKâ€™s strategic response, by:

* Analysing national and international data to determine the effect of different measures and strategies on a range of public health, social and economic outcomes
* Using emerging sources of data as new evidence from the unfolding pandemic comes to light
* Coordinating with research groups nationally and internationally
