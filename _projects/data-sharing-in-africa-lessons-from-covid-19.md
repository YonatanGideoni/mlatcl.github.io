title: "Data sharing in Africa: lessons from COVID-19"
excerpt: The COVID-19 pandemic intensified the need for timely and accurate data
  to inform policymaking. Countries across Africa have developed, and are still
  developing, innovative uses of data and statistics to monitor the extent of
  the spread of COVID-19 among their populations. Drawing from real-world
  examples, this projects the lessons offered by these innovations for future
  data policy frameworks.

The COVID-19 pandemic intensified the need for timely and accurate data to inform policymaking. Countries across Africa have developed, and are still developing, innovative uses of data and statistics to monitor the extent of the spread of COVID-19 among their populations. Countries across Africa have developed, and are still developing, innovative uses of data and statistics to monitor the extent of the spread of COVID-19 among their populations. Access to mobile phone data, for example, has allowed new ways of tracking the disease and its social implications.

Organised in collaboration with Data Science Africa, [this project](https://mamutorine.github.io/about/) is reviewing lessons from the use of data science in Africaâ€™s COVID-19 response, with the aim of identifying policy interventions that can support more effective use of data. It is surveying innovations in data access and use, extracting insights that can inform future policy development, and developing a blueprint for effective data sharing collaborations.
