European Learning and Intelligence Systems Excellence (ELISE) is a consortium of artificial intelligence (AI) research hubs that connects Europe’s leading researchers in machine learning and AI. ELISE’s vision is of a powerhouse of European AI that advances machine learning technologies and their application to areas of pressing scientific and social interest. 

In support of this aim, in 2021 ELISE brought together Europe’s leading technologists to create a strategic research agenda for its work. ELISE-supported research will seek to increase the technical sophistication of machine learning, to ensure AI technologies perform well in deployment, and to align technology development with society’s needs and concerns 

Prepared by the ELISE consortium for the European Commission, [this Strategic Research Agenda](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f55e90f6a7294f66f94d30d/609a39235e25e3d64bb65053_ELISE-strategic-research-agenda-web.pdf) sets out areas in which further technology development can help create trustworthy AI systems.
