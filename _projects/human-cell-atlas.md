The Human Cell Atlas programme aims to chart the properties of human cells, building a reference map of the human body that can be used to understand human health and to treat disease. 

Contributing to this work, our Human Cell Atlas project is creating a detailed single-cell and spatial atlas of embryos in late organogenesis. Its aim is to build an in-silico atlas of the human embryo. Its approach is to deploy machine learning approaches to large-scale dimensionality reduction, focusing on latent variable techniques such as GPLVM or variational auto-encoders.
