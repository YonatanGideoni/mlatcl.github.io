overview: >-
  Students interested to work with me should come up with a grain of an idea
  before reaching out. If there is a match I would be happy to discuss to flesh
  out the details and create a project out of it. I always believed that part of
  doing a project is coming up with ideas and angles ripe for exploration. 


  I am broadly interested in probabilistic machine learning and applications in climate science.

student_learn: They will develop broad expertise in machine learning research.
  Exploring a specific idea and testing it out through experiments. Finally, how
  to write a cohesive research thesis based on experimental findings.
project_objective: To develop research skills in probabilistic machine learning,
  reading and summarising existing literature, reproducing existing models in
  python and finally proposing innovations which build upon prior work.
project_bigger_picture: The student will be a part of an eco-system with PhD
  students and research fellows specialising in different areas of machine
  learning. They will get a chance to refine their project ideas in
  collaboration with other researchers who specialise in a broad array of
  research involving Gaussian processes, re-inforcement learning, software
  engineering, climate science and AI for science.
