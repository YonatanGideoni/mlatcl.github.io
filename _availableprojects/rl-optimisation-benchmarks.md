student_learn: You will learn about optimisation problems (i.e., resource
  allocation)  and how they computationally represent real-world problems. You
  will also learn about the traditional and RL algorithms that solve these
  problems.

title: Optimisation Benchmarks for Online RL
overview: "Reinforcement Learning algorithms have been applied in different
  domains. Now there is a growing interest in applying RL algorithms to
  optimisation problems. Such algorithms are a better alternative to produce
  near-optimal solutions in dynamic environments, compared against exact or
  approximation algorithms. Benchmarks are a key element in the development and
  evaluation of novel algorithms as they enable a standardised comparison of
  these algorithms' performance. In this project you will provide a set of
  optimisation benchmarks to evaluate online RL algorithms. "
project_objective: You will provide the code for a set of optimisation problems
  benchmarks for online RL algorithms based on [this
  paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.10641). These benchmarks include three
  well-known resource allocation problems (i.e., Bin Packing, Newsvendoor, and
  Vehicle Routing) with their respective baselines, and evaluation tools (e.g.,
  automated performance graphs). The code must be built in a flexible fashion in
  a way that the sets of problems or baselines are easily extended in the
  future.
project_bigger_picture: This project is part of a wider project called AutoAI.
  The aim is to build explainable and maintainable machine learning systems. You
  will have a chance to interact with the wider team and a successful project
  will form part of the portfolio of AutoAI demonstrations.
