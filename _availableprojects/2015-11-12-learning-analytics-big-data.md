title: "'Skill Learning': Analytics with Big Data"
overview: |-
  I have access to large existing data sets which contain the potential to show skill development on real-world tasks for large numbers of people (i.e. n>1,000,000 in domains of chess and online maths education). Using theory from the cognitive science of learning, advanced statistical models and open source programming languages (R, Python) we will test theories of what makes learning most effective. The ambition will be to design more effective learning practices.
