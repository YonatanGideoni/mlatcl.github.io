student_learn: You will learn about Gaussian processes and associated ML
  modelling choices, interact with multiple deep learning frameworks and develop
  and publish a Python library.

title: A User-centric Meta-library for Gaussian Processes
overview: Gaussian processes are a powerful tool to quickly formulate
  interpretable machine learning models and make sense of data. A number of
  implementations of Gaussian processes are available in the Python ecosystem
  for data-science. They are based on several linear algebra backends for
  machine learning, such as [GPy (numpy)](https://sheffieldml.github.io/GPy/),
  [GPflow (tensorflow)](https://www.gpflow.org/), and [GPyTorch
  (pytorch)](https://gpytorch.ai/). Existing GP libraries have a strong focus on
  research, enabling experts to formulate new types of models and inference
  schemes. The aim of this project is to provide a common and light interface to
  these libraries that makes it easy for domain-experts to build GPs that work
  in practice.
project_objective: >-
  You will provide a Python library that will enable researchers that are not ML
  experts to use Gaussian processes in their projects. After surveying the
  landscape of GP libraries, you will design and implement a meta-library for
  machine learning with Gaussian processes.

  We aim to provide software and documentation that is easy to use, understand and communicate.
project_bigger_picture: >-
  This project is part of the [Accelerate Science
  initiative](https://acceleratescience.github.io/) that aims to advance
  scientific discovery with machine learning. Easy-to-use libraries enable
  researches to apply ML to their projects quickly and confidently.

  You will have a chance to interact with the wider team both in the machine learning and broader scientific communities.
