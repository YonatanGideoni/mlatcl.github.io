title: "From Research Data Ethics Principles to Practice: Data Trusts as a
  Governance Tool"
abstract: Artificial intelligence and data science offer tools that could
  advance the pace of discovery across research domains. By processing large
  datasets, extracting insights from new data sources, and identifying patterns
  or relationships that would not otherwise have been visible to researchers,
  these technologies can advance understandings of science and society.
  Achieving this potential will require that researchers have access to data
  that is governed in ways that respect both the benefits that data use can
  bring and the risks to individuals, communities and society that can follow.
  Recent years have seen numerous examples of the ways in which these risks can
  be manifest, some of which also serve to highlight the ethical implications of
  pursuing behavioural research using advanced data analytics. Over the same
  period, researchers and policymakers have been active in developing frameworks
  that enable ethical data use. A range of data sharing structures exist, which
  are differently suited to achieving different governance aims. In seeking to
  connect the desire to share data with concerns about individual rights, data
  trusts offer a promising mechanism for future development. For researchers,
  data trusts offer a means of accessing multiple data types in a more
  streamlined way than current contract-based structures allow. For research
  participants, they provide a route to exerting informed influence over how and
  for what purposes data about them is used.
