Deep learning has transformed the way large and complex image datasets can be processed, reshaping what is possible in bioimage analysis. As the complexity and size of bioimage data continues to grow, this new analysis paradigm is becoming increasingly ubiquitous. In this Review, we begin by introducing the concepts needed for beginners to understand deep learning. We then review how deep learning has impacted bioimage analysis and explore the open-source resources available to integrate it into a research project. Finally, we discuss the future of deep learning applied to cell and developmental biology. We analyze how state-of-the-art methodologies have the potential to transform our understanding of biological systems through new image-based analysis and modelling that integrate multimodal inputs in space and time.
