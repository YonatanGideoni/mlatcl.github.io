title: "Bottom-up Data Trusts: Disturbing the 'One Size Fits All' Approach to Data Governance"
abstract: |
  From the friends we make to the foods we like, via our shopping and
  sleeping habits, most aspects of our quotidian lives can now be
  turned into machine-readable data points. For those able to turn
  these data points into models predicting what we will do next, this
  data can be a source of wealth. For those keen to replace biased,
  fickle human decisions, this data—sometimes misleadingly—offers the
  promise of automated, increased accuracy. For those intent on
  modifying our behaviour, this data can help build a puppeteer's
  strings. As we move from one way of framing data governance
  challenges to another, salient answers change accordingly. Just like
  the wealth redistribution way of framing those challenges tends to
  be met with a property-based, 'it's *our* data' answer, when one
  frames the problem in terms of manipulation potential,
  dignity-based, human rights answers rightly prevail (via fairness
  and transparency-based answers to contestability concerns). Positive
  data-sharing aspirations tend to be raised within altogether
  different conversations from those aimed at addressing the above
  concerns. Our data Trusts proposal challenges these boundaries.
