title: "Creating a European AI Powerhouse: A Strategic Research Agenda from the
  European Learning and Intelligent Systems Excellence (ELISE) consortium"
abstract: |
  ELISE’s vision is of a Powerhouse of European AI. Motivated by the
  ambition to establish European leadership in AI and create a new
  generation of trustworthy AI systems, ELISE will build a network of
  the continent’s leading AI researchers. Together, this network will
  pursue pan-European research collaborations that tackle issues of
  pressing scientific and social concern.

  This Strategic Research Agenda sets out ELISE’s roadmap for creating
  AI technologies that are technically advanced, robust in deployment
  and aligned with social values. It outlines how technological
  advances can contribute to European policy ambitions for AI, and the
  support needed from technologists and policymakers to maintain
  European leadership in AI.
