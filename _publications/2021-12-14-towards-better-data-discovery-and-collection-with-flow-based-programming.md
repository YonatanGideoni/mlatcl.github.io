title: Towards Better Data Discovery and Collection with Flow-Based Programming
abstract: Despite huge successes reported by the field of machine learning, such
  as voice assistants or self-driving cars, businesses still observe very high
  failure rate when it comes to deployment of ML in production. We argue that
  part of the reason is infrastructure that was not designed for data-oriented
  activities. This paper explores the potential of flow-based programming (FBP)
  for simplifying data discovery and collection in software systems. We compare
  FBP with the currently prevalent service-oriented paradigm to assess
  characteristics of each paradigm in the context of ML deployment. We develop a
  data processing application, formulate a subsequent ML deployment task, and
  measure the impact of the task implementation within both programming
  paradigms. Our main conclusion is that FBP shows great potential for providing
  data-centric infrastructural benefits for deployment of ML. Additionally, we
  provide an insight into the current trend that prioritizes model development
  over data quality management.
