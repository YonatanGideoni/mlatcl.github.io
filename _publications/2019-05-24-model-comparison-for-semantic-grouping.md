abstract: We introduce a probabilistic framework for quantifying the semantic
  similarity between two groups of embeddings. We formulate the task of semantic
  similarity as a model comparison task in which we contrast a generative model
  which jointly models two sentences versus one that does not. We illustrate how
  this framework can be used for the Semantic Textual Similarity tasks using
  clear assumptions about how the embeddings of words are generated. We apply
  model comparison that utilises information criteria to address some of the
  shortcomings of Bayesian model comparison, whilst still penalising model
  complexity. We achieve competitive results by applying the proposed framework
  with an appropriate choice of likelihood on the STS datasets.
