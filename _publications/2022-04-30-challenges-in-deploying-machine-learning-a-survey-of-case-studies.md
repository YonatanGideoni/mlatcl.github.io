abstract: |
  In recent years, machine learning has transitioned from a field of
  academic research interest to a field capable of solving real-world
  business problems. However, the deployment of machine learning
  models in production systems can present a number of issues and
  concerns. This survey reviews published reports of deploying machine
  learning solutions in a variety of use cases, industries and
  applications and extracts practical considerations corresponding to
  stages of the machine learning deployment workflow. By mapping found
  challenges to the steps of the machine learning deployment workflow
  we show that practitioners face issues at each stage of the
  deployment process. The goal of this paper is to lay out a research
  agenda to explore approaches addressing these challenges.
