This chapter explores the role that data governance can play in shaping the development of AI technologies. It starts by considering how the role of law and governance systems in the digital environment is shifting, prompted by public incidents that have exposed the negative or unintended consequences of data use for both individuals and society. As the ‘wild west’ view of the digital sphere as an ungoverned, or ungovernable space, becomes increasingly outmoded, the chapter considers how policymakers and legislators are increasingly seeking means through which to assert social values in digital systems.
