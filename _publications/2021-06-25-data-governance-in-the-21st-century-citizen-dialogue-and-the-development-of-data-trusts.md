title: "Data Governance in the 21st century: Citizen Dialogue and the
  Development of Data Trusts"
abstract: As more data is created from a growing range of digitally mediated
  interactions, there are opportunities to use data in policy – from nowcasting
  metrics for economic performance, to the design of targeted public-health
  interventions. Many of these new forms of data are the result of happenstance;
  they are generated by individual citizens in the course. of daily activities,
  without having been collected with a public policy goal in mind. While use of
  such data can create significant benefits, its use alsobrings new potential
  forms of harm and risks, further disenfranchising individuals in decisions
  about data sharing and use. In this context, there is a demand for
  institutions that can bridge the desire to share data for social and economic
  benefit, with concerns about the vulnerabilities that such data sharing can
  create.
