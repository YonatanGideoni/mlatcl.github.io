abstract: "The challenge of data governance in the 21stÂ century is to bridge aspirations to share data for personal or public benefit with concerns about the harms to individuals, communities and society that can emerge from data (mis)use. Current legislative frameworks already create a constellation of data rights to mitigate against these harms, but exercising these rights can be difficult, demanding time, resources and expertise that are out of reach for many. By empowering individuals to assert their data rights, data trusts offer a way for individuals and groups to influence how and why organisations are able to use data about them. However, despite much recent excitement surrounding the role data trusts could play in creating trustworthy data governance institutions, gaps in understanding about the form and function of these trusts remain.

A workshop convened by the Data Trusts Initiative on 26 November 2020 set out to explore the areas in which further work is needed to advance the development of data trusts, delineating the questions where interdisciplinary research can help make progress in establishing data trusts that respond to real-world challenges."
