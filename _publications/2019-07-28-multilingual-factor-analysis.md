title: Multilingual Factor Analysis
abstract: In this work we approach the task of learning multilingual word
  representations in an offline manner by fitting a generative latent variable
  model to a multilingual dictionary. We model equivalent words in different
  languages as different views of the same word generated by a common latent
  variable representing their latent lexical meaning. We explore the task of
  alignment by querying the fitted model for multilingual embeddings achieving
  competitive results across a variety of tasks. The proposed model is robust to
  noise in the embedding space making it a suitable method for distributed
  representations learned from noisy corpora.
