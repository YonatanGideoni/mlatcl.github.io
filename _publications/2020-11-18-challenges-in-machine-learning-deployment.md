title: Challenges in Machine Learning Deployment
abstract: In recent years, machine learning has received increased interest both
  as an academic research field and as a solution for real-world business
  problems. However, the deployment of machine learning models in production
  systems can present a number of issues and concerns. This survey reviews
  published reports of deploying machine learning solutions in a variety of use
  cases, industries and applications and extracts practical considerations
  corresponding to stages of the machine learning deployment workflow. Our
  survey shows that practitioners face challenges at each stage of the
  deployment. The goal of this paper is to layout a research agenda to explore
  approaches addressing these challenges.
