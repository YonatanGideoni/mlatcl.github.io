title: Multi-view Learning as a Nonparametric Nonlinear Inter-Battery Factor Analysis
abstract: >
  Factor analysis aims to determine latent factors, or traits, which summarize a
  given data set. 

  Inter-battery factor analysis extends this notion to multiple views of the data. In this paper 

  we show how a nonlinear, nonparametric version of these models can be recovered through the 

  Gaussian process latent variable model. This gives us a flexible formalism for multi-view learning 

  where the latent variables can be used both for exploratory purposes and for learning 

  representations that enable efficient inference for ambiguous estimation tasks. Learning is 

  performed in a Bayesian manner through the formulation of a variational compression scheme which 

  gives a rigorous lower bound on the log likelihood. Our Bayesian framework provides strong 

  regularization during training, allowing the structure of the latent space to be determined 

  efficiently and automatically. We demonstrate this by producing the first (to our knowledge) 

  published results of learning from dozens of views, even when data is scarce. We further show 

  experimental results on several different types of multi-view data sets and for different kinds 

  of tasks, including exploratory data analysis, generation, ambiguity modelling through latent 

  priors and classification.
