title: Multi-view Learning as a Nonparametric Nonlinear Inter-Battery Factor Analysis
abstract: |
  Factor analysis aims to determine latent factors, or traits, which summarize a given data set. 
  Inter-battery factor analysis extends this notion to multiple views of the data. In this paper 
  we show how a nonlinear, nonparametric version of these models can be recovered through the 
  Gaussian process latent variable model. This gives us a flexible formalism for multi-view learning 
  where the latent variables can be used both for exploratory purposes and for learning 
  representations that enable efficient inference for ambiguous estimation tasks. Learning is 
  performed in a Bayesian manner through the formulation of a variational compression scheme which 
  gives a rigorous lower bound on the log likelihood. Our Bayesian framework provides strong 
  regularization during training, allowing the structure of the latent space to be determined 
  efficiently and automatically. We demonstrate this by producing the first (to our knowledge) 
  published results of learning from dozens of views, even when data is scarce. We further show 
  experimental results on several different types of multi-view data sets and for different kinds 
  of tasks, including exploratory data analysis, generation, ambiguity modelling through latent 
  priors and classification.
