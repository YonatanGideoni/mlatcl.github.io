title: AI for research and innovation
excerpt: By analysing complex datasets and uncovering previously unknown
  patterns, machine learning has the potential to accelerate scientific
  discovery across the sciences – from healthcare to climate science,
  fundamental physics to conservation, and more. Realising this potential
  requires action to equip researchers from across disciplines with the skills
  they need to use machine learning in their work, and to build a community of
  practice at the interface of data science and other disciplines. Activities in
  this theme advance research, training, and engagement at the interface of AI
  and the sciences.
