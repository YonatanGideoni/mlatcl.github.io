  How can AI enhance scientific discovery?


  By analysing complex datasets and uncovering previously unknown patterns, machine learning has the potential to accelerate scientific discovery across the sciences – from healthcare to climate science, fundamental physics to conservation, and more. The use of AI for scientific discovery offers opportunities to create exciting new research agendas that both advance data science methods and generate new insights for research. Realising this potential requires action to equip researchers from across disciplines with the skills they need to use machine learning in their work, and to build a community of practice at the interface of data science and other disciplines.
overview_long: While excitement about the potential of artificial intelligence
  (AI) technologies continues to build, a gap is emerging between our
  aspirations for the benefits of AI and our ability to deploy these
  technologies to tackle real-world challenges. Achieving the full potential of
  AI – and its benefits for society and the economy – requires the ability to
  safely and effectively deploy AI systems at scale. Research in this theme
  considers the advances in AI and system design that can manage the complex
  interactions that arise in deployment.
