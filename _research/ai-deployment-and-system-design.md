title: AI deployment and system design
excerpt: While excitement about the potential of artificial intelligence (AI)
  technologies continues to build, a gap is emerging between our aspirations for
  the benefits of AI and our ability to deploy these technologies to tackle
  real-world challenges. Achieving the full potential of AI – and its benefits
  for society and the economy – requires the ability to safely and effectively
  deploy AI systems at scale. Research in this theme considers the advances in
  AI and system design that can manage the complex interactions that arise in
  deployment.
