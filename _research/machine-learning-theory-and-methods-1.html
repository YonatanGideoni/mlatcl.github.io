excerpt: <p>Probability provides a language for us to describe our knowledge (or ignorance) of the world. To building statistical models, we need to structure our knowledge about a specific system such that we can reduce our ignorance using observations. These techniques are essential components for building interpretable computational structures that can be used for decision making.</p>
