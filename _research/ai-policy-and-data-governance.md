title: AI policy and data governance
excerpt: Policy plays a crucial role in influencing where, how and for whose
  benefit machine learning systems are developed and deployed. Safe and reliable
  deployment of machine learning systems requires policy frameworks that embed
  trustworthy data governance; that promote the use of machine learning in areas
  where it has potential to improve public wellbeing; and that account for the
  wider implications of technological change on individuals and communities.
  Research in this theme considers what policy levers can shape the development
  of AI technologies.
