  What policy levers can shape the development of AI technologies for societal
  benefit?


  Policy plays a crucial role in influencing where, how and for whose benefit machine learning systems are developed and deployed. Safe and reliable deployment of machine learning systems requires policy frameworks that embed trustworthy data governance; that promote the use of machine learning in areas where it has potential to improve public services and wellbeing; and that account for the wider implications of technological change on individuals and communities.


  ML@CLâ€™s policy projects identify policy interventions that can support the development of trustworthy AI technologies and that help share the benefits of AI across society.
