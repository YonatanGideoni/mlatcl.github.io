title: Machine learning theory and methods
excerpt: Probability provides a language for us to describe our knowledge (or
  ignorance) of the world. To building statistical models, we need to structure
  our knowledge about a specific system such that we can reduce our ignorance
  using observations. These techniques are essential components for building
  interpretable computational structures that can be used for decision making.

overview_short: AI:FAR focuses on understanding future trajectories in AI
  progress; how AI might impact society in particularly profound and
  long-lasting ways; and how AI can be guided and governed. We examine specific
  impact and risk scenarios, such as the role of AI in contexts ranging from
  scientific progress, to security, to critical systems such as global
  agriculture. We also study the roles of principles, norms and soft and hard
  forms of governance in shaping the trajectory of AI. Lastly, we take an
  exploratory and participatory approach to AI futures, drawing on the expertise
  of affected communities, technology developers, domain experts and civil
  society.
