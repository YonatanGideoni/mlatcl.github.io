The group meets on Friday's at 16:00 for an hour long "black board talk". The idea of this session is that no aides other than the whiteboard and pen are used for the talk.

Talks can be from group members and/or guests. Guests are welcome. The atmosphere is informal and discussive (so there may be interuptions). 

We like as many people to contribute as possible, so try and create ways for making sure everyone gets to ask a question (there are no silly questions).
