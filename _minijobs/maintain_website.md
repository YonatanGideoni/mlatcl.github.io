This mini-job is at the heart of the groups operation. As well as maintaining the overall structure of the page, it involves educating the rest of the group in how the page works, and encouraging them to update as part of their own mini-jobs and research activities. 

Our page is a statically generated site that makes use of GitHub hosted Jekyll. There are two ways of updating pages, either by pull request to the GitHub repo directly, <https://github.com/mlatcl/mlatcl.github.io>, or through the Netlify Content Management System, <https://mlatcl.netlify.app/admin/>

For details on the structure and maintenance of the structure see <https://github.com/mlatcl/mlatcl.github.io/tree/main/admin>

The advantage of the Netlify interface is that it dictates the structure of the site, it's also easier for those not used to pull-requests to maintain that way.

Each of the other mini-jobs ends up being responsible for one or more parts of the website, the content should be coming from them. The role in this mini-job is to encourage others to update, explain how its done, and fix and maintain the underlying structure to make it convenient to do so. 

Some examples of updates that are required include:

1. Adding news events etc.
2. Ensuring publications are updated regularly.
3. Ensuring group events are regularly updated.
4. Ensuring the people are represented across the group research themes.
