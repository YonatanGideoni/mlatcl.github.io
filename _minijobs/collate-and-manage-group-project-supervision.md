 Across the group many of our PhD students and post docs get involved in project supervision. You look after:

1. Making sure these projects are collated and updated by May before the year they are due to be offered.
2. Making sure that when the students are allocated, this is reflected on our list.
3. Letting those in the group know about supervision training, and differences in supervision between Prt II, Prt III and MPhil.
4. Bringing the students we supervise together as a group to give them a cohort feel.
