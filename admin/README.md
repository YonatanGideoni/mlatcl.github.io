# Netlify CMS Admin

This is the Netlify CMS Administration area for the ML@CL page.

We use this CMS to make editing content easier for those that don't directly access through GitHub. But that can also make some tasks easier even for those that do.

To edit the content, go to <https://mlatcl.netlify.app/admin> and login with your GitHub account.
